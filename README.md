# Distributed-Systems-Cluster-Simulation-Framework
This project implements a minimal container orchestration system built with Flask and Docker, designed to simulate the basic principles of platforms like Kubernetes. It allows users to create compute nodes (Docker containers), launch pods , and monitor node health with automatic failure recovery and pod migration.
